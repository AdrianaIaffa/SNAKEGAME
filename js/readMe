## Snake Game - README

### Introduction

This README provides an overview of the Snake Game project, highlighting issues faced during development and the corresponding resolutions.

### Issues and Resolutions

1. **Grid and Snake Initialization:**
   - **Issue:** Initially, there were issues with moving the snake along the grid, and adding and removing tiles didn't work as expected.
   - **Resolution:** Implemented snake movement using `unshift` and `pop` methods to maintain the snake's array.

2. **Food Placement:**
   - **Issue:** Placing food randomly on the grid was straightforward, but ensuring the snake could eat it proved challenging.
   - **Resolution:** Integrated food eating with snake movement to manage the snake's growth effectively.

3. **Random Food Placement:**
   - **Issue:** Ensuring that food doesn't overlap with the ever-growing snake array.
   - **Resolution:** Implemented a random number generator with a `while` loop to ensure food placement doesn't collide with the snake.

4. **Collision Detection:**
   - **Issue:** Setting hard limits for the grid and detecting collisions with walls and the snake itself.
   - **Resolution:** Added hard limits within the `handleMovement` function and implemented a `checkForHits` function to detect collisions with the snake's own body.

5. **Game Over:**
   - **Issue:** Triggering a game over event when collisions occur, and displaying a game over message.
   - **Resolution:** Created a game over message display with a sound effect and a delayed modal popup for restarting the game.

6. **Levels and Difficulty Settings:**
   - **Issue:** Implementing game speed levels and a scoring system.
   - **Resolution:** The snake speeds up after scoring 50 points, and a level up display is added. The scoring system resets when the game starts again and is linked to the speed.

### Game Design

- **Visual Simplicity:** The game design prioritizes simplicity, keeping distractions to a minimum. The grid is the main focus, and visuals are contained within it.

- **Alert Display:** Important game alerts and messages are displayed within an HTML div, ensuring that the game's layout remains consistent.

### Conclusion

This Snake Game project addresses various issues and improvements to create an engaging and functional game. The README serves as a reference for developers and players alike, providing insights into the game's development process and design choices. Enjoy playing the game!
