//this functions initializes the game







// selects the container .grid where the individual cells will be appended to





//creats a variable with the width
 //creates a variable with the length
 //creates a variable that multiplies width by length
 //creates an empty array called cells, where each individual 
    //cell created in the function startGame will be pushed
    //to create a grid


//create the initial posiiton snake as an array
//creates a new array that takes the initial positon f startsnake
    //





//creates a variable that contains a random number
//this doesnt make sense but what i want to do is compare the index number of the snake
    //to the index number of the foodcell and make sure they dont match







//function that creates each cell inside the grid according to the number
    //stored on cellcount

    //creates a variable called cell and creates a div
    //adds the index by adding text inside each div
    //same as above but attaches it as a dataset
    //calculates the height of the cell and styles it
    //calculates the width of the cell and styles it
    //appends each div to the grid to create a grid

    //pushes each cell inside the cell array



//calls back th function addSnake and passes startSnake as a param
//calls back function addFood with no parameters passed






//creates a function called addSnake and pases an index number as param


//matches the indexnumber from the cells array and adds a class of snake to add the snaekk on the board


//creates a function called removeSname and passes an index as a parm

//passes the currentsnake array inside the cells and removes the claslist


//function that i dont really know is attached to automatic snake






//addFood function passes an index number

//adds a food class to a cell in the let cells array and tha randome number generated
  //is passed as an index

//removeFood passes an index as a number

//removes class of food to cell and passes the currentsnake as a param





//handleMovement function that passes an event as a param

//event.keycode attached to the const key







//callsbacks to remove the currentsnake from the current position as its about to change to a new positon

//if eventkeycode matches the const up and currentSnake is bigger or equal to the width of the board


//i don tknow what this means
